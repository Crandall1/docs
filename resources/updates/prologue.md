# Prologue

> 🐇 [The BVAL NFT Project](https://tokens.bvalosek.com/project) has expanded to Layer 2. We're further down the rabbit hole than ever now.
>
> 🌈 I hacked my [Screensaver.World](https://www.screensaver.world/created/0x303EeFeDeE1bA8e5d507a55465d946B2fea18583) NFTs to continuously generate VIBES inside of them as an intrinsically staked digital asset.
>
> 🎢 The owner of an NFT can unstake the VIBES to their wallet at any time, which is a one-way operation. Staked VIBES stay inside the NFT across transfers or sales.
>
> 💎 This captures the value of holding my art, and allows my collectors to capitalize on that value by unstaking the generated VIBES. I'm calling this mechanic _**Provenance Mining**_.
>
> 🥳 This is just the first phase: Distribution. VIBES is an experimental asset, but it was designed with several utility use cases in mind.
