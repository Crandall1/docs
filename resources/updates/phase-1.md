# Phase 1

We started with [Distribution](prologue.md): getting **VIBES** to people interested in the project and active in the Polygon NFT space via the [Founders](../../vibes-protocol/vibes-token/#founders-airdrop-program) airdrop totaling more than 1.3 million **VIBES** across 100+ addresses. 

Currently 26 of the 30 million **VIBES** for the first [provenance mining grant program](../../vibes-protocol/vibes-token/#provenance-mining-grant-program) with @bvalosek's art have been locked in 26 1/1 Screensaver World NFTs.

### What's next?

There is no roadmap for **VIBES**, this will never be a linear path. VIBES is an [idea maze](https://cdixon.org/2013/08/04/the-idea-maze): we're here to make dope art and ship cool stuff while exploring on-chain tech and coordination.

But even without a roadmap, it's important to have a sense of where we're going. The next phase of VIBES will be foundational as core parts of the protocol thesis are tested and the initial paths of the idea maze are explored.

## The Maze

### Artists

A [proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/sickvibes.eth/proposal/QmdwL7CMqaDjha3nJvm69HtHjUSH5Ma8ozhxm7YF4aYiRh) passed to allocate another 30 million **VIBES** to new artists in the form of [provenance mining](../../vibes-protocol/provenance-mining.md) grants.

* What happens when new [artists](../../community/artists.md) are responsible for distributing large portions of network equity from the [VIBES treasury](../../vibes-protocol/vibes-token/#provenance-mining-grant-program) to their collectors? 
* How will artists use [VIBES Lab](../../vibes-protocol/vibes-lab.md) to \(re\)circulate **VIBES** inside of their NFTs in a fully permissionless way?
* Will collectors be incentivized to buy pieces injected with **VIBES**?
* Will artists approach the VIBES NFTs they make differently than their usual pieces?
* How will this round of artists explain VIBES to their collectors and followers?

### Community

A [proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/sickvibes.eth/proposal/QmdwL7CMqaDjha3nJvm69HtHjUSH5Ma8ozhxm7YF4aYiRh) passed to allocate 3 million **VIBES** for community programs to reward people who contribute to VIBES via stipends and bounty payouts.

* Will people be incentivized to [contribute](../../community/contributing/) in exchange for early network equity?
* Are [bounties](../../community/contributing/bounties.md) a useful on-boarding mechanisms for new contributors?
* How will early VIBES NFT collectors use the **VIBES** mined inside of their NFTs?
* What type of emergent branding, memes, and culture can be bootstrapped via an early-phase cryptonetwork?
* How will YOU contribute to VIBES?

### Protocol

Several protocol additions are being designed right now to add to the on-chain [smart contract cluster](../architecture.md) that is currently powering VIBES.

* Will [Governance Farming](../../vibes-protocol/governance-farming.md) incentivize market liquidity? 
* When should VIBES deploy its [Liquidity Mining](../../vibes-protocol/liquidity-mining.md) program?
* Should the rate and total-lifetime-value numbers used with [provenance mining](../../vibes-protocol/provenance-mining.md) be tweaked?
* How can we create open standards around NFT collections and artist-owned NFT contracts that allow for interoperable curation and discovery mechanics?
* What are the specific mechanics and actions that [VIBES Party](../../vibes-protocol/vibes-party.md) will allow?
