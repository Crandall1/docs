# Welcome to VIBES

**VIBES** is an decentralized digital art collective and [cryptonetwork](vibes-token/vibes-token.md) on the Polygon L2 blockchain.

We're an experimental [digital community sandbox](community/governance.md) for artists, collectors,  builders, and enthusiasts who want to learn by doing. 

We favor permissionless problem-solving and biasing towards action. 

{% hint style="info" %}
**TLDR**: We're here to make art and build cool things together. 

We are absolutely doing this shit live.
