# Welcome to VIBES

**VIBES** is an decentralized digital art collective and [cryptonetwork](vibes-token/vibes-token.md) on the Polygon L2 blockchain.

We're an experimental [digital community sandbox](community/governance.md) for artists, collectors,  builders, and enthusiasts who want to ship cool stuff, make killer art, and push the boundaries of NFT and web3 applications.
