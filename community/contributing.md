# ðŸ’ª Contributing

VIBES is a community-owned protocol, and **VIBES** is our proof-of-work token. 

Network equity is distributed to those who contribute, with plenty of ways beyond coding to pitch in.

{% hint style="info" %}
VIBES encourages **permissionless problem solving**: build first, ask permission later. 
{% endhint %}

## How To Contribute

Contributing to VIBES is just doing anything to impact or improve the protocol. 

How this looks is entirely up to you and your skills \(or lack thereof ðŸ˜¨\). If you aren't sure where to start, ask in [Discord](https://discord.gg/qDrsjcGR2F) or check out any active community bounties.

### Examples and Suggestions

A non-exhaustive list of ways to contribute:

* **Create design assets**. Logos, icons, illustrations, guides, social avatars / headers. Be creative and be part of establishing the visual language and branding of VIBES.
* **Create memes**. Dank memes can earn you bags. Shitpost your way to fame and fortune.
* **Engage in Discord discussion**. Help answer questions, direct people to resources, discuss NFT trends, art, crypto, tech, and life.
* **Product ideation and brainstorming**. What else can we do with VIBES? What are some cool things we can do with NFTs? What else should we build?
* **Social Media engagement**. Hype the collective on the timeline, share dank memes created by yourself or others. 
* **Get others Involved**. VIBES is an early-stage protocol that is looking for curious and optimistic people to shape where we go. Get em in the Discord, get stacked.
* **Write docs and guides**. Cleanup organization and grammar, write new [guides](../resources/guides/), create more cross-links. These docs are a living product and an important resource for the protocol.
* **Build cool stuff.** Can you code web3 apps? Know how to write smart contracts? Are you a Figma wizard or UX pro? Have some awesome ideas for new products? Let's make it happen.
* **Contribute to Screensaver World.** [Screensaver](https://screensaver.world) and VIBES are independent, but aligned protocols. Help out over there \(product dev, flash auctions, etc\) and get paid in **VIBES**.

The above ideas are really just the basics. VIBES is not tied to any specific market or product, we ship cool stuff on any medium.

Want to start a VIBES fragrance line? 24/7 "lofi beats to study or relax to" channel featuring VIBES artists? A metaverse events venue? If you are a VIBES member, you get to decide what belongs in VIBES.

## How To Get Paid

Contributions to VIBES are rewarded with network equity via **VIBES** token community stipends issued by the [VIBES multisig](governance.md#vibes-multisig). Stipend amount and rationale is fully at the discretion of the multisig, but will always be transparently announced with justifications provided.

When considering the "worth" of these stipends, it's best to think of them in terms of network equity vs monetary equivalence. Until sufficient liquidity can be established, it will be difficult to swap significant amounts of **VIBES** for more liquid assets such as **MATIC** or **USDC**.

Once larger market depth and liquidity can be established, community stipends may start being priced in terms of their equivalent monetary value.
