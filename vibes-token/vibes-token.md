# VIBES Token

**VIBES** is a [governance](../community/governance.md), utility, and coordination tool for the VIBES cryptonetwork. **VIBES** holders own a portion of the network equity of VIBES, allowing them to influence the direction of the protocol and art collective through various governance mechanisms.

**VIBES** is not a currency nor representation of financial value. It is not a reserve-backed token. It is an experimental digital asset that explores the consequences of tokenizing the act of holding art over time. 

This concept is known as [Provenance Mining](../protocol/provenance-mining.md).

The token address for **VIBES** is:

*  `0xd269af9008C674B3814b4830771453D6a30616eb` \([polygonscan](https://polygonscan.com/token/0xd269af9008c674b3814b4830771453d6a30616eb)\). 

See [Architecture](../protocol/architecture.md) for all contract addresses.

Like all tech and programs in VIBES, this token is an experiment. Proceed at your own risk.

## Supply and Current Allocations

The initially minted supply for **VIBES** was 1,000,000,000 \(1 billion\). The token contract has an active minter role held by the Treasury EOA that will be revoked once a Gnosis Safe can be deployed on Polygon sometime in July 2021.

Currently, funds have been allocated and distributed incrementally:

* **120,000 VIBES** used to establish initial quickswap liquidity
* **1,300,000 VIBES** distributed in the initial airdrop
* **30,000,000 VIBES** allocated for Provenance Mining v1
* **30,000,000 VIBES** allocated for Provence Mining v1.1
* **3,000,000 VIBES** allocated for Community Stipends v1

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Currently the treasury is managed by an EOA secured by a hardware wallet.** Once Gnosis ships their Safe product on Polygon \(see [this article](https://blog.gnosis.pm/gnosis-safes-multichain-future-b676b5b8f431)\), managed funds will be transfered to the safe, secured with at least a 3 of 5 multisig, and the minter role on the token contract will be permanently removed.

In addition, on-chain mechanisms to lock and vest funds over time may be deployed for further decentralization and safety.

## Initial Airdrop

An initial **VIBES** airdrop program ran roughly until July 12th 2021, which included the following recipients:

* Top 20 collectors on Screensaver v0 and v1 contracts
* All holders of **BVAL** or @bvalosek NFTs on Ethereum
* All collectors of @bvalosek Screensaver art
* All artists collected on Screensaver by @bvalosek
* Anybody showing genuine interest in the project during this time

The following amounts where airdropped:

* **10,000 VIBES** to all addresses on the airdrop list
* **10,000 VIBES** to the nine addresses that voted on the initial test proposal
* **10,000 VIBES** to anybody providing at least 5,000 VIBES worth of VIBES-MATIC liquidity on QuickSwap

The goal of this airdrop was to distribute network equity to small artists, collectors, and crypto enthusiasts in the space and encourage a grassroots bootstrapping of market liquidity.

All recipients of the initial airdrop are considered **Founding Members** of VIBES.

{% hint style="info" %}
Roughly **1,300,000 VIBES** where distributed during this airdrop.

## Provenance Mining

The primary distribution method of VIBES is [Provenance Mining](../protocol/provenance-mining.md), which is managed autonomously by locking VIBES from the treasury into the [VIBES Wellspring contract](../protocol/architecture.md).
