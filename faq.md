### Where can I browse VIBES NFTs?

[Sick Vibes Dot XYZ](https://sickvibes.xyz) ü§ô

### What is Polygon? How do I connect to VIBES?

Polygon \(previously called Matic\) is a protocol and a framework for building and connecting Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks, but generally when people talk about Polygon they are talking about the Polygon PoS network that can bridge digital assets bidirectionally with the Ethereum mainnet.

VIBES currently is deployed to the Polygon PoS network.

### Where do I get some VIBES?

You can mine, earn, or buy **VIBES**.

### How does VIBES relate to Screensaver.World?

VIBES is closely aligned with [Screensaver.World](https://screensaver.world), but there is no official association. Currently all VIBES NFTs are minted on their platform. The VIBES functionality built on top of Screensaver NFTs was done so permissionlessly -- one of the advantages of the open nature of blockchain applications and a core tenant of VIBES: **build first, ask for permission later**.

### How much are VIBES worth?

**VIBES** are worth whatever somebody is willing to pay for them. **VIBES** are worth the value of the tokenized representation of holding a VIBES NFT over time. **VIBES** are worth the equivalent amount of **MATIC** \(or any other digital asset\) that can be used to purchase bags on QuickSwap. **VIBES** are worth the precieved value of having control over the VIBES art collective and cryptonetwork.

ü§î All of these answers are correct. The real question is: what are **VIBES** worth to you?
{% endhint %}

### Can I inject my own NFTs with VIBES?

For now, this is a permissioned feature that is not widely available. VIBES artists are currently chosen by the VIBES multisig and allocated **VIBES** to inject their NFTs with via the [Provenance Mining Grant Program](vibes-protocol/vibes-token/#provenance-mining-grant-program).

In the future, there will be mechanisms to allow anybody to permissionlessly "bring their own **VIBES**" to inject their NFTs with.

### How do I become VIBES Member?

Becoming a VIBES member starts in your heart. If you want to build cool stuff with NFTs or make sick art, you're already most of the way there.

If you want to make it official, grab some **VIBES** and hop into the [Discord](https://discord.gg/qDrsjcGR2F).

{% page-ref page="vibes-protocol/vibes-token/where-to-get-vibes.md" %}

### How do I contribute to VIBES?

Build something cool. Write something awesome. Make dope memes. Shitpost on Twitter to hype the collective. Edit these docs for spellign mistakes. 

Contributing earns you **VIBES**, and everyone getting stacked.

{% page-ref page="community/contributing/" %}

### How do I get the VIBES Member role in Discord?

Have at least 10,000 VIBES vote power and follow the instructions in the [\#üë•-join channel on Discord](https://discord.gg/3h6tmv3BBu).

### How are new VIBES artists added?

This is currently done on a case-by-case basis and is a permissioned action. If you have somebody in mind that would make a an awesome VIBES artist, reach out to the VIBES multisig.

{% page-ref page="community/artists.md" %}

### How did you "hack" Screensaver World NFTs to mine VIBES?

That expression is a verbal abstraction -- a phrase that evokes the right understanding while being a lossy representation of the actual on-chain mechanisms that mediate the feature.

"I hacked my Screensaver World NFTs to continously mine VIBES over time" is more accurately said as "I deployed a bookkeeping contract that references the Screensaver NFT contract and locks **VIBES** that can be released via a timelock mechanism".

### Will VIBES make me rich? Should I sell my VIBES? Is VIBES a good investment?
